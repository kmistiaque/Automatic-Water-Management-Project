Autonomous Water Management System

This project, developed by Group RVG, is an innovative solution for intelligent water management. It addresses the issues of water wastage and scarcity by leveraging a diverse set of sensors and a microcontroller to monitor and control water resources.

Key Features:

Wastage Reduction: Prevents water tank overflow through real-time monitoring.

Water Quality Monitoring: Uses a TDS sensor to check water quality and alert users when tank cleaning is needed.

Smart Pump Control: Controls a water pump based on water level, weather forecasts, and potential rainfall.

SMS Notifications: Alerts users via a GSM module for important events, such as poor water quality.

Real-time Data: Integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and analyze weather data.

This system is designed to promote a more sustainable and efficient approach to water conservation.

Tools Used

ESP8266 Microcontroller: The core of the system, responsible for processing data and controlling components.

Ultrasonic Sensor: Measures water level in the tank.

TDS Sensor: Monitors the water's total dissolved solids to assess quality.

GSM Module: Sends SMS notifications to the user.

Relay: Controls the water pump based on the system's logic.

OpenWeatherMap API: Provides real-time weather data for intelligent pump control.

Arduino IDE: Used for programming the ESP8266.
